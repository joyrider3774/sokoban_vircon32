Vircoban for vircon32 is a remake of the classic Sokoban game. 
You as the player need to push boxes to specific locations in the level. 
Once all boxes are pushed to the correct spots the level is finished. 
Vircoban is basically a sokoban engine, it contains all the game rules and has the ability to use (asci) level packs. 
The game engine also has an undo system up to 1000 moves

This version is a cleanup / port of my old Sokoban gp2x version, using open source assets and adapted code

## Game Features:
- Multiple Supplied Levels spread over different (default) level packs using asci text level sets
- Max 26x15 level size, will filter ascii sets if levels are too big
- Autosaves progress

## Playing the Game:
Vircoban Will start up at a main menu, here you can choose the level pack you wish to play by using left and right when the level pack name is selected (it's between "<>" signs).
When a level pack is loaded for game play, the level selector will show up. Here you select what level you wish to play, if it has been unlocked yet. By default the selector will show the last unlocked level.
After you solved a level one extra level will be unlocked. you always have to solve to last unlocked level in order to unlock the next one. If you are new to Sokoban, i suggest starting with the SokWhole levels.

### Level (pack) Authors
The Game uses Levels created by different Authors almost all levelpacks are loaded through level set sok files. 

I used the sok files available for download on http://sokobano.de/en/levels.php as they contained the Authors as well as the title of the levels and comments in the files.
I implemented a parser for these levels so they can now be used with the game.

Below you can find all authors and details for the different .sok files that is supplied with this game.
